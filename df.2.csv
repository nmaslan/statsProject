Photographed during a climbing expedition, these remote fjords are some of the most beautiful and untouched places I have ever visited. It's a place that is changing drastically. With glacier and sea ice melting rapidly the ocean is absorbing more energy from the sun resulting in warmer air which in effect is creating faster thaw in permafrost. Permafrost melt creates a high release of methane in both the air and in water. This cycle increases weather patterns trapping in warmer temperatures, perpetuating and increasing the melt. As we see more permafrost exposed the result is quite beautiful and lush, but a finite scenario. As ice melts tundra fields will slowly dry out leaving behind a barren desert, effecting the wildlife and marine life as a result.

Wallace is best known for independently conceiving the theory of evolution through natural selection; his paper on the subject was jointly published with some of Charles Darwin's writings in 1858. Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the Amazon River basin and then in Wallace while traveling in the the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the faunal divide now termed the Wallace Line, which separates the Indonesian archipelago into two distinct parts: a western portion in which the animals are largely of Asian origin, and an eastern portion where the fauna reflect Australasia.Atlas moths were often considered the largest moths in the world in terms of total wing surface area. They are also amongst the heaviest, Females are appreciably larger and heavier than the males.Atlas moths are said to be named after either the Titan of Greek mythology, or their map-like wing patterns. In Hong Kong the Cantonese name translates as ""snake's head moth"", referring to the apical extension of the forewing, which bears a more than passing resemblance to a snake's head.

They prefer much higher levels of sweet and salt, and they are more sensitive to some bitters than adults are. Featured in ""The Science of Delicious"" story in the current issue of National Geographic.",1448301618,1,"AM",261927,0

Normally the routine involves the kayak tracking the sharks, but in this case the white shark decided to track the kayak instead. To take this photograph I tied myself to the tower of the research boat and leant out over the water. Once the first shark saw the kayak, it dove down to inspect it from below and then slowly rose to check it out. I took the shot a fraction of a second after its dorsal fin emerged, just as the research assistant turned to look behind him.

When I set the camera up on this small bridge, I had no idea of what I would see the next morning.A healthy, large vibrant male was a wonderful surprise. Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai India is a jewel of the world. Mumbai can show the world the way forward in living with large cats! As there is no other place like it on the planet.SGNP is more proof that we humans live with majestic animals in urban areas without even knowing they are there - AND without major problems - if we let them be. Leopards are the most adaptable and the most persecuted cat on our planet. Protect Sanjay Gandhi National Park and Aarey and all the buffer zones. Recent coverage on some local TV networks is an embarrassment to India’s success living with tigers and leopards AND the incredible work done by the staff of SGNP and Vidya Athreya.Do not lie about the truth, and the reality of the success of living with leopards in your race for TV viewers - there has not been an attack in in SGNP in the last 3 years!!!!!! Read the piece below for the TRUTH. India is so unique in the world in their spiritual and cultural respect for living with tigers, leopards and elephants etc. Take this honor with the responsibility for saving SGNP and all the animals within.The problems in the past in SGNP were created by humans - relocating leopards from 200km away into the city in an area that already had resident males or females - human mistakes, caused problems 13 years ago.http:ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/12/leopards-moving-to-cities-textOur natural world is simply perfect and incredibly amazing.

In conjunction with other pursuits, the men of Naromuru have worked as guides and porters on Mount Kenya for generations. With employment opportunities limited in the region, working with tourists and expeditions provides access to relatively steady income. A recent decline in tourism to Kenya has strained the livelihoods of many of those who depend on the industry. During our many fireside conversations, porters expressed a dire hope that tourism soon returns to its previous levels. I hope so, too.
