#Our Topic
Social Media has grown not only in the role that it plays in the life of the everyday person, but also the role it plays in the marketing strategies and plans of large companies. We thought the idea of examining social media messages and different features of them would be a relevant and interesting topic to study due to its relevance and potential applications. This project should be of interest to people because it could potentially reveal underlying behavioral, possibly subconscious, patterns of people and how it relates to their responses to different social media output.  
#Why People Should Care
We wanted to highlight different features of the text component of tweets. One of the most important text features we wanted to identify was sentiment. Sentiment Analysis is the analysis of text passages by identifying words or phrases with positive, negative, and neutral connotations within the text and using those identifiers to determine how positive, negative or neutral a given passage is. To create the sentiment score for each tweet we created a function in R that gave a score based on the number of positive, negative and neutral words and phrases. The function did this by matching words in the text with libraries of positive and negative owrds. Parts of the code and these libraries were taken from https://sites.google.com/site/miningtwitter/questions/sentiment/sentiment. We also added additional libraries in order to create a more complete library and hopefully capture terms that were left out in the AFINN dictionaries. The additional variables we included were Word Count, which counts the number of words in a given post. Passive Score, which identified if the post was more passive meaning it would say the grass was cut by John versus an active sentence which would say John cut the grass. Photo score which indicated if the post also contained a picture. Geo score which indicated if the post mentioned a country or geographic region. Personal score which informed us if the sentence was directed at the reader, meaning it contained the words "you", "you've", "your", etc. We also included an impersonal score, which indicated if the post was more about National Geographic, which we identified by words such as "we", "ours", "our", etc. These were the variables we used to analyze the text from tweets and we attempted to use these variables to see if it was possible to make a relatively accurate predictive model for the productivity of future tweets using these components. We measured popularity by summing the favorite count and twice the retweets. Our rationale behind doubling the weight of the retweets was that there is additional effort to retweet and we thought it should be more effective. We then split each of the tweets into 3 categories based on its popularity score. The category "Popular" was defined as tweets that were in the 25th percentile or higher in regards to popularity score. "Average" tweets were categorized as tweets that had a popularity score above the 75th percentile and below the 25th percentile. "Unpopular" tweets were marked as tweets that had a popularity score below the 75th percentile. 
We used Random Forests in order make a learning algorithm that would predict the popularity of a tweet based on the other factors we mentioned. What we
